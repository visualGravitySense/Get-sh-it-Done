# Get-sh-it-Done
üóìÔ∏è Get (Sh)it Done (GSD) Task Management System. The Get (Sh)it Done (GSD) Task Management System is a productivity tool that integrates Obsidian and Telegram to streamline task management and enhance productivity.


### Roadmap for **The Get (Sh)it Done (GSD) Task Management System**  
**Objective**: To create an integrated task management system that combines the power of Obsidian's Markdown-based note-taking with React Vite's front-end flexibility and Telegram bot notifications to enhance productivity.

#### **Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Integrations**

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up project repositories:
     - [React Vite Front-end](https://vitejs.dev/)
     - [Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/visualGravitySense/obsidian-plugin)
     - [Telegram Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) for real-time notifications.
   - Define technology stack: React, Vite, Obsidian API, Telegram Bot API, and backend server for handling tasks and notifications (Node.js or Python).
   - Initialize the codebase for each part of the system.

2. **Basic Task Management Functionality**
   - **Obsidian Integration**:
     - Create basic task structure using Markdown syntax (checkboxes, deadlines, and tags).
     - Implement a plugin to read, create, edit, and delete tasks directly from Obsidian notes.
   - **React Vite Task Management Frontend**:
     - Build a user-friendly UI to display tasks created in Obsidian.
     - Allow users to filter, edit, and complete tasks through the React UI.
   - **Database Setup**:
     - Integrate a task database (MongoDB, Firebase, or PostgreSQL) to store and sync tasks across platforms.
   - **Telegram Bot Integration**:
     - Create a basic Telegram bot that receives notifications from the system.
     - Implement task reminders and real-time updates via Telegram.

#### **Phase 2: Task Synchronization and Advanced Features**

1. **Obsidian Task Synchronization**
   - Implement a two-way sync between the React front-end and Obsidian notes.
     - Tasks created in Obsidian should automatically update on the React interface.
     - Changes made in React should update the Obsidian plugin.

2. **Telegram Bot Enhancements**
   - Allow users to create, complete, and delete tasks via Telegram.
   - Enable scheduling reminders, deadlines, and task updates via bot commands.
   - Implement real-time notification system:
     - Notify users of upcoming deadlines.
     - Remind users to complete overdue tasks.
   
3. **Task Organization & Custom Views**
   - **Filters and Tags**: Implement filtering tasks by tags, deadlines, priorities, etc.
   - **Task Views**:
     - Provide different task views (e.g., today, week, or monthly overview).
     - Allow users to create custom views for task grouping (e.g., by project or deadline).
   - **Search Functionality**: Add a search bar for task lookup.

4. **User Management**
   - Implement user authentication (OAuth or JWT).
   - Allow multiple users to manage tasks in a shared workspace.
   - Implement permissions and roles (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer).

#### **Phase 3: Productivity Enhancements**

1. **Task Templates and Quick Add**
   - Create task templates for recurring or common tasks.
   - Implement a ‚ÄúQuick Add‚Äù feature in the front-end and Telegram bot to rapidly add new tasks.

2. **Progress Tracking & Analytics**
   - **Task Completion Tracking**: Add statistics showing task completion rates, progress over time, etc.
   - **Productivity Analytics**: Implement productivity reports (e.g., tasks completed per day, time spent per task).

3. **Goal Setting and Task Prioritization**
   - Allow users to create goals with associated tasks.
   - Implement task prioritization (e.g., urgent, important) and a sorting algorithm to highlight high-priority tasks.

---

#### **Phase 4: Integration with Other Productivity Tools**

1. **External Calendar Integration**
   - Sync tasks with Google Calendar or other calendar apps for deadline tracking.
   - Add calendar views for tasks in the React front-end.

2. **Third-Party App Integrations**
   - Explore integration with platforms like Notion, Trello, or Slack.
   - Enable importing/exporting tasks from/to other productivity tools.

---

#### **Phase 5: Finalization and Deployment**

1. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Thorough testing of all core features.
   - Conduct usability testing for smooth user experience across the React front-end, Obsidian, and Telegram bot.

2. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the React Vite front-end on a scalable platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
   - Ensure Telegram bot is hosted on a reliable server for real-time functionality.
   - Package and release the Obsidian plugin to the Obsidian plugin marketplace.

3. **Documentation & Tutorials**
   - Provide clear documentation for installing and using the GSD system.
   - Create tutorials for using each integration (Obsidian, Telegram bot, front-end UI).

---

#### **Future Plans and Potential Features**

1. **Mobile App Support**
   - Develop a mobile app using React Native for easy task management on the go.
   
2. **Advanced Notifications**
   - Implement more sophisticated notification mechanisms like push notifications or email alerts.
  
3. **AI-Assisted Task Management**
   - Explore AI features for task recommendations based on user behavior or predictive task completion times.

This roadmap ensures a step-by-step development of the GSD system, from basic task management integration to a fully featured productivity tool. It aims to streamline workflows, combine the strengths of Obsidian and React Vite, and improve overall user productivity with the help of Telegram real-time notifications.
